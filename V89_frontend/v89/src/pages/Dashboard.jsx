      <h1>Clean energy</h1>
      <p>
        Clean energy is not new; the use of renewable energy, such as solar,
        wind, and hydropower, has been around for a long time, but it hasn't
        changed much for many years. However, climate change has accelerated the
        need to adopt cleaner, renewable energy to reduce dependence on fossil
        fuels. Although many countries have invested in renewable energy, the
        high cost of research and development to build the technology and
        infrastructure has been a barrier. Therefore, the innovation in cleaner
        energy hasn't grown as rapidly as expected. Yet many companies have
        adopted a cleaner, more efficient way of operating. For example, Blue
        World Technologies has been developing methanol fuel cells to power
        heavy-duty vehicles.

        is another company that has been changing the way it produces steel by
        using electric arc furnace (EAF) technology, creating a zero-carbon,
        low-emission process. These are just a few companies that have innovated
        in renewable energy by adopting new manufacturing processes.
